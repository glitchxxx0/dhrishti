# Object Recognition Project Manifest | Author - Deepak Kumar Soni

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an object recognition system that can detect and classify objects in images or video streams using deep learning techniques. The system will leverage pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with OpenCV for image and video processing.

## Tech Stack
- Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Computer Vision Library: OpenCV
- Pre-trained Models: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- Programming Language: Python

## Project Components

### 1. Data Preparation
- `data/images/`: Directory to store images for training and testing.
- `data/videos/`: Directory to store video files for testing.
- `src/data_utils.py`: Module for data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.

### 2. Model Setup
- `models/pretrained/`: Directory to store pre-trained models (e.g., YOLO weights).
- `models/custom/`: Directory to store custom trained models.
- `src/model_utils.py`: Module for loading and configuring pre-trained models or training custom models.

### 3. Inference and Visualization
- `src/inference.py`: Module for running object detection and classification on images or videos.
- `src/visualization.py`: Module for visualizing the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

### 4. Main Script
- `main.py`: The main entry point for the project, handling command-line arguments and running the desired functionality (e.g., training, inference, visualization).

### 5. Dependencies
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the required Python packages and their versions.

### 6. Documentation
- `README.md`: Project documentation, including installation instructions, usage examples, and additional information.
