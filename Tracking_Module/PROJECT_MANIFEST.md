**Project Manifest: Tracking Module for Virtual Production**

**Overview:**
Develop an embedded system for 6DoF (6 Degrees of Freedom) motion tracking using sensor fusion of IMU and optical tracking data. The system will be designed for 
virtual production applications, enabling real-time tracking of objects for integrating virtual elements.

**System Components:**

**Hardware:**
1. **Main Controller:** ESP32 development board with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
2. **IMU Sensor:** MPU-9250 9-axis motion tracking IC (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer).
3. **Optical Tracking:**
    - **Infrared LED Arrays or Markers:** High-power infrared LEDs or LED arrays to be mounted on the tracked object.
    - **Infrared Camera Module:** Global shutter camera module with infrared bandpass filter for detecting LED markers.
4. **Power Supply:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack or wired power supply.
5. **Enclosure and Mounts:** 3D printed enclosures and mounts for housing electronics and attaching to tracked objects.

**Software:**
1. **Firmware:**
    - IMU sensor data acquisition and filtering
    - Optical tracking data processing (marker detection, pose estimation)
    - Sensor fusion algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter, complementary filter)
    - Calibration routines
    - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth communication for data streaming and configuration
2. **Host Software (PC/workstation):**
    - Receive and visualize tracking data
    - Camera calibration and undistortion
    - User interface for configuration and calibration
    - Integration with virtual production software (e.g., game engines, compositing tools)

**Implementation Milestones:**

1. Set up the development environment and test IMU sensor integration.
2. Implement IMU data acquisition and filtering algorithms.
3. Integrate infrared camera module and develop marker detection algorithms.
4. Implement sensor fusion algorithms to combine IMU and optical tracking data.
5. Develop calibration routines for IMU, camera, and tracked object.
6. Design and 3D print enclosures and mounts.
7. Implement wireless communication for data streaming and configuration.
8. Develop host software for data visualization, camera calibration, and user interface.
9. Integrate with virtual production software and test in real-world scenarios.
10. Optimize performance, power consumption, and reliability.
11. Conduct extensive testing and debugging.
12. Document and release the project.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Support for multiple tracked objects
- Integration with external motion capture systems
- Implement advanced tracking algorithms (e.g., model-based tracking, deep learning)
- Develop mobile apps for configuration and monitoring
- Cloud-based data processing and storage

This project aims to deliver a robust, accurate, and versatile tracking solution tailored for virtual production applications, enabling seamless integration of real and virtual elements.
