**Project Manifest: Motion Tracking for Virtual Production using TensorFlow/PyTorch**

**Overview:**
This project aims to develop a cost-effective, high-performance, real-time motion tracking system tailored for virtual production applications. By leveraging deep learning techniques, frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and cloud-based resources like Google Colab, the system will enable accurate tracking of actors, props, and other objects in a production environment, facilitating seamless integration of virtual elements with live-action footage without the need for expensive local hardware.

**System Components:**

**Hardware:**

2. **Multi-camera Setup:** Synchronized array of high-resolution RGB cameras with global shutter and infrared support.
3. **Depth Sensors:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) or structured light depth sensors for depth map acquisition.
4. **Motion Capture Suits/Markers:** Specialized suits or marker setups for actor tracking and motion capture.

**Software:**
1. **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow or PyTorch with appropriate libraries and dependencies.
2. **Google Colab:** Jupyter notebooks hosted on Google Colab for data processing, model training, and large-scale computations.
3. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing (Local Workstation):**

    - Integration with conventional motion capture data (if applicable)
5. **Model Training (Google Colab):**
    - Loss functions for different tasks (detection, pose estimation, tracking)
    - Optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam) and learning rate schedulers
    - Techniques for handling occlusions and challenging environments
    - Leverage Google Colab's GPU and TPU resources for efficient training
6. **Inference and Tracking (Local Workstation):**
    - Real-time inference and post-processing
    - Data association and tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman Filter, SORT, Deep SORT)
    - Integration with virtual production software and game engines
